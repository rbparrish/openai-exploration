# Openai Exploration
Personal exploration of &amp; helpful tools for using OpenAI

The following use cases are implemented:
- Single request and response from ChatGPT (see [basic_chat.py](openai_exploration/basic_chat.py))
- Usage of an already created assistant (see [assistant.py](openai_exploration/assistant.py))

Use cases I'm planning to explore next:
- Using a custom GPT from python
- How to use a custom GPT from an assistant

Basic implementation coming soon:
- Creating and managing a list of assistants
- Move usage examples of how to leverage the code into separate documentation
- Implement basic test cases
